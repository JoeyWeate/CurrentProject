Interactive board game to teach kids how to code

By using radio frequency identification tags (RFID) in combination with hidden integrated
circuits students’ manipulations on the physical board game will be translated into programming code in a
virtual world. For example when a game piece is added to the board, the computer will recognize the
exact position, piece type, and configuration with the help of the hardware found in the board and game
pieces. This allows the student to witness how problem solving techniques apply in a programmer’s
world.
